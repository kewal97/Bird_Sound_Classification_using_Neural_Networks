# Bird Sound Classification Using Neural Networks
Used neural network for bird sound classification on 12 species from the Birdcall competition. Two models were built: a binary classification for two species and a multi-class for all 12. Using transfer learning, we adapted a pre-existing neural model. The performance was satisfactory, but we identified areas for future research improvement.
